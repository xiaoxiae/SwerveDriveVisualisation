# Default IntelliJ Processing Project
This project is simply a barebones Java project including the [Processing library](https://processing.org/).

## Setup

Simply download the project and open it in the [IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

Note that the repository **includes Processing's core.jar**, so you might want to start over by deleting the .git folder to not include a binary file in your repository.
